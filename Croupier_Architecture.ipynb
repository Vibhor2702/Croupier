    "## 3. Key Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Multi-Tenancy Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision:** Separate MongoDB collection per organization (`org_<name>`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- **Data Isolation:** Complete separation prevents data leakage between tenants\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Collections can be sharded independently based on tenant size\n",
    "- **Performance:** Queries don't need tenant filters (WHERE org_id = ?), reducing overhead\n",
    "- **Compliance:** Simplified GDPR/data residency compliance (delete collection = delete all tenant data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off:** Higher collection count vs. simpler queries and better isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Authentication Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision:** JWT tokens with embedded `admin_id` + `organization_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- **Stateless:** No server-side session storage required → horizontal scaling\n",
    "- **Performance:** Single token validation vs. database session lookup\n",
    "- **Multi-tenant:** Organization context encoded in token → automatic tenant routing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Measures:**\n",
    "- bcrypt with 12 rounds for password hashing\n",
    "- JWT expiration enforced\n",
    "- Dependencies validate tokens on protected endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Layered Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision:** Strict layer separation (Router → Service → Repository)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Testability:** Each layer can be unit tested independently\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Changes to database logic don't affect business logic\n",
    "- **Code Reuse:** Services can be used by multiple routers\n",
    "- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new data sources (e.g., cache layer)"

    "### Question 1: Is this architecture scalable?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, to a significant extent, but with important caveats and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability Strengths**\n",
    "- **Horizontal Scaling:** Stateless JWT allows adding multiple API servers without session synchronization\n",
    "- **Data Isolation:** Each organization has its own collection enabling targeted optimization and sharding\n",
    "- **Independent Growth:** Organizations can grow independently without affecting others\n",
    "- **FastAPI Performance:** Async capabilities handle high concurrency efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability Challenges**\n",
    "- **Collection Explosion:** MongoDB has practical limits at 100,000+ collections; metadata management becomes challenging\n",
    "- **Namespace Limits:** MongoDB namespaces (database.collection) have size constraints\n",
    "- **Schema Migrations:** Changes must be applied to N collections, increasing complexity\n",
    "- **Resource Overhead:** Each collection has index metadata and file descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation Strategies**\n",
    "- Collection Pooling: Group small/inactive organizations into shared collections\n",
    "- Archival: Move inactive organizations to cold storage\n",
    "- Monitoring: Track collection count and implement alerts at thresholds\n",
    "- Hybrid Approach: Use per-collection for large tenants, shared for small ones"

    "### Q2: Technology Stack Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FastAPI\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- High performance (comparable to Node.js/Go)\n",
    "- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation\n",
    "- Native type safety with Pydantic\n",
    "- Modern async/await support for I/O-bound operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Smaller ecosystem compared to Django/Flask\n",
    "- Async paradigm adds complexity for simple CRUD\n",
    "- Less mature ORM integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MongoDB\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Schema flexibility for evolving data models\n",
    "- Horizontal scaling through sharding\n",
    "- Fast write operations (document-based)\n",
    "- Natural JSON representation for REST APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- No ACID transactions across collections (in standalone mode)\n",
    "- Collection count limits at scale (≈100k collections)\n",
    "- Application-layer referential integrity\n",
    "- Higher memory footprint vs. SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collection-per-Tenant Pattern\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Security:** Complete data isolation between tenants\n",
    "- **Performance:** No tenant_id filters needed in queries\n",
    "- **Compliance:** Simple tenant deletion (drop collection)\n",
    "- **Optimization:** Per-tenant indexing strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Collection explosion beyond 10,000+ tenants\n",
    "- Schema migrations require N operations\n",
    "- Cross-tenant analytics complexity\n",
    "- Metadata overhead per collection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JWT Authentication\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Stateless architecture (no session storage)\n",
    "- Horizontal scaling without sticky sessions\n",
    "- Self-contained authorization (admin_id + org_id in token)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Cannot revoke tokens before expiration (without Redis/blocklist)\n",
    "- Token size grows with claims\n",

    "### Q3: Alternative Database Multi-Tenancy Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports three primary multi-tenancy strategies, each optimized for different scale and isolation requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pattern 1: Shared Collection with Tenant ID**\n",
    "\n",
    "All tenant data in a single collection with `tenant_id` discriminator.\n",

    "- **Cons:** Weak isolation, noisy neighbor effects, all queries require tenant filter, index bloat\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** <1000 similar-sized tenants, frequent cross-tenant reporting, lower isolation needs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pattern 2: Database per Tenant**\n",

    "Complete physical isolation with dedicated database per tenant.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Each tenant gets own database\n",
    "- customer_acme_db\n",
    "- customer_globex_db\n",
    "- customer_initech_db\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "**Use Case:** Enterprise clients (HIPAA/SOC2), <100 high-value tenants, geographic data residency\n",

    "Croupier's **collection-per-tenant architecture** provides an optimal balance for organizations scaling from hundreds to thousands of tenants. The implementation demonstrates production-ready patterns with clear growth paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Strengths:**\n",
    "- **Layered Design:** Clean separation enables independent testing and maintenance\n",
    "- **Type Safety:** Pydantic validation throughout reduces runtime errors\n",
    "- **Security-First:** Industry-standard bcrypt + JWT patterns\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Stateless design enables horizontal scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Known Limitations:**\n",
    "- Collection count scales to ≈10,000 tenants before architectural changes needed\n",
    "- No token revocation mechanism (requires Redis integration)\n",
    "- Cross-tenant analytics requires aggregation across collections\n",

    "\n",
    "This architecture is **production-ready for initial deployment** and provides clear scaling paths. The modular design allows incremental improvements without requiring complete rewrites. With the documented enhancements, this system can grow from a startup MVP to an enterprise-scale platform serving hundreds of thousands of organizations.\n",
