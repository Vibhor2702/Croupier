    "- **FastAPI Performance:** Async capabilities handle high concurrency efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability Challenges**\n",

    "- **Namespace Limits:** MongoDB namespaces (database.collection) have size constraints\n",
    "- **Schema Migrations:** Changes must be applied to N collections, increasing complexity\n",
    "- **Resource Overhead:** Each collection has index metadata and file descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation Strategies**\n",
    "- Collection Pooling: Group small/inactive organizations into shared collections\n",
    "- Archival: Move inactive organizations to cold storage\n",
    "- Monitoring: Track collection count and implement alerts at thresholds\n",

    "*Cons:* Very high operational complexity, connection pool management challenges, MongoDB database limits, schema migrations across N databases, cross-tenant queries extremely difficult, higher infrastructure costs\n",
